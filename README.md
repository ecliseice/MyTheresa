# FilmBrowser

A React + TypeScript single-page application built with Vite.  
It fetches movies from **TMDB** (The Movie Database), shows details, and allows the user to manage a wishlist.  
State is managed with **Redux Toolkit** and persisted to `localStorage`. Styling: **SCSS**.

## ðŸ“¦ Using the `dist/` folder

The contents of `dist/` are the final build.  
Deploy `dist/` to any static hosting provider (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, nginx, etc.).  

---

## ðŸ§ª Running Tests

This project uses **Jest + React Testing Library**.

### Run all tests:
```bash
npm run test
```

- Test files live inside `__tests__/` folders under `src/components`, `src/pages`, etc.  
- The configuration is defined in `jest.config.cjs`.
